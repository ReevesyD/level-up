# Career Skills Gap Analyzer - LLM Chain Requirements

## 1. System Overview
Python-based system using chained LLM calls to analyze skills gaps between LinkedIn profiles and job listings.

## 2. LLM Chain Components

### 2.1 Profile Analysis Chain
- Skills extraction from LinkedIn profile text
- Experience level assessment
- Skill categorization and clustering
- Expertise level determination

### 2.2 Job Requirements Chain
- Required skills extraction
- Seniority level analysis
- Priority determination for requirements
- Technical vs soft skills categorization

### 2.3 Gap Analysis Chain
- Skills matching and comparison
- Missing skills identification
- Current vs required level analysis
- Gap prioritization based on importance

### 2.4 Learning Path Chain
- Resource recommendation
- Timeline generation
- Prerequisite mapping
- Progress milestone creation

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 LLM Integration
- OpenAI API integration
- Prompt engineering for each chain
- Context management between chains
- Response parsing and validation

### 3.2 Chain Orchestration
- Sequential chain execution
- Error handling and recovery
- Context preservation
- Result validation between chains

### 3.3 Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- openai library
- pydantic for validation
- pytest for testing

### 3.4 Performance
- Chain execution optimization
- Response caching
- Parallel processing where possible
- Token usage optimization

## 4. Chain Flow Requirements

### 4.1 Data Flow
- Profile text → Skills List
- Job listing → Requirements List
- Skills + Requirements → Gaps
- Gaps → Learning Path

### 4.2 Prompt Requirements
- Consistent output formats
- Clear instruction sets
- Context preservation
- Error prevention

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
